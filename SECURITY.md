# Security Policy

This repository holds the content for the
Inclusive Naming Initiative [website](https://inclusivenaming.org).

Is is a static site built with 
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) framework for building out the content,
and 
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/)
as the CSS (styling) framework.

It is unlikely you have found security-related bug in the content in this
repository, as opposed to the frameworks listed above.  But if you have,
please [open an issue](https://github.com/inclusivenaming/org/issues).
